# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at dusting off my React skills. Although I have substantial experience with React, I took a break of a little over a year from frontend development and decided it was time to revisit the basics to refresh the knowledge I had acquired.

The result is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using modern web development practices to create a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Player Management:** Allows switching between players and keeps track of the active player.
- **Win Detection:** The game accurately detects when a player has won or when there is a tie.
- **Modular Codebase:** The project leverages modular component design for maintainability and scalability.
- **Styled Components:** Uses `styled-components` for a clean and manageable approach to styling.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Type safety and improved code clarity with TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

- **React** with Hooks
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **Styled Components** for component-level styling
- **Functional Programming Paradigms** for state management and component rendering

## Motivation

After focusing primarily on backend and infrastructure-related tasks, I felt the need to revisit React to ensure my frontend skills remain sharp. This project serves as both a learning opportunity and a demonstration of best practices for building a simple but complete React application.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement game history to allow players to navigate back to previous moves.
- Add animations for smoother user interactions.
- Extend the game with custom themes and difficulty levels.
- Explore additional state management libraries, such as Redux, for more complex features.
